# HookChart settings, strategies and performance audit

Checked: 2026-11-10. Source audit covers HookChart settings, controller, renderer, strategy engine, live feeds, terminal/fullscreen integrations and profile persistence.

## Implemented in this change

- The profile has a top-level **Графік** tab reusing the canonical HookChart settings form (Основні, Стратегії, Гарячі клавіші). Changes save to the same per-user `hookChartPreferences` field and propagate to signed-in HookCharts via AuthContext; pending changes are isolated to the account.
- The profile editor mounts no chart canvas, live-feed sockets or candle polling. Live chart-only counts are not faked in the profile.
- A single `strategyPreferencePatch` applies all strategy presets in both locations.
- Chart drawing scope rehydration uses incoming user preferences rather than stale local settings.
- Bounded 45-second cache coalesces identical remote analysis candle requests across chart instances, removes failed requests, and guards overlapping polling.
- OI comparison requires a real time-window baseline. Historical impulse events no longer use the most recent OI result.
- Regression tests cover the shared editor, preset parity, account merge, OI baseline and request deduplication.

## Connected settings verified by source review

Chart controller consumes preferences for history limits, padding, toolbars, drawing scopes, hotkeys, crosshair width, market stats, indicators, grid, candle colors, support/resistance, auto levels, densities, OI/funding, strategy selection and multiple overlays. Account updates are persisted by `updateProfileData` and normalized by `normalizeOriginalHookChartPreferences`.

## Settings requiring further product integration

The canonical form reads 92 `prefs.*` keys. The main chart controller, renderer, live feed, strategy engine, terminal and fullscreen components do not have an operational consumer for these fields beyond storing/displaying their controls:

- `sortEnabled`, `sortDisabled` — sorting configuration
- `analyzedIntervals` — generic analysis intervals
- `roundDistance` — round-number distance column
- `showNearestLevels` — nearest-level list
- `densityTop`, `densityBaseVolume` — density table presentation
- `oiBaseChange` — base-coin OI comparison
- `rBtcTf`, `rBtcCandles` — correlation currently uses chart timeframe and fixed reference history depth
- `duplicateCrosshair` — cross-chart synchronization
- `notificationOpenNew`, `notificationDialog`, `singleWindowSize`, `pagingButtons` — window and paging options awaiting integration

These controls are now disabled and labelled as not yet implemented in both the chart and the shared profile editor. Existing stored values are retained. Operational settings, including liquidation controls, remain editable. This makes the current implementation explicit without presenting an inactive control as a working feature.

## Verification and deployment

- Verification includes TypeScript, the complete offline test suite and a production build. DOM regressions cover Replay portal remounts, latest-candle crosshair data, viewport preservation and read-only unsupported settings.
- Native fullscreen layout on real devices and authenticated browser flows still require deployment validation.
- Before publishing: `npm ci && npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`; keep `.env` and named Docker volumes untouched.
- Benchmark 2–8 simultaneous terminal charts, test profile-to-chart synchronization and inspect network request counts.
